    As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully
    vaccinated might befeeling the return-to-normal fantasy.
    But Dr. Cardona warns that now still

    “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19
    vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against
    severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No
    vaccine offers 100% 
    protection against illness, yet it does give
    you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of
    being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”<br>

   <h2 class="can"> Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to
others, including other vaccinated people?</h2>
<p>
   While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower
   rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
   response to vaccines.

   “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health
   disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines.
   We are still collecting
   
   data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”
