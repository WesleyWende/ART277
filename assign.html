<p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
<P>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University’s science faculty to study
    as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </P>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit
    us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as
    follows:</p>
    <!-- my unordered list starts here-->
<ul>
    <!--these are my list below, they are formed by using the li tag as seen below-->
    <li>First semester: 9 October 2022</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2023</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2023</li>
    <!--unordered list ends here-->
</ul>
    
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
<p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
<p>
    At the <b>Starz University</b>, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects
    fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated
    researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas
    you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>

    <!--ordered starts here-->
<ol>
    <!--within my lists i used subscript and superscript tags-->
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F),
    when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup>
    increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>  
    <!--abbreviation tags were added to the list below-->
   <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Styling Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li> 
</ol>
    
<p>
    
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd
    expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd
    need to know? Thanks.
</p>
<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To
    answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>
    <!--my description or defintion list starts here-->
<dl>
    
    <!--the dt and dd tags were used to describe the terms or names in the description list-->
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
        would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </dd>
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice
        this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling
        their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow
        students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
        believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
        movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
        however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
        cold.
